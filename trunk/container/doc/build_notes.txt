Glossitope Maven Build Notes - container:
========================================

Prerequisite:
------------
Requires Maven 2 - http://maven.apache.org/.
Install/unpack Maven 2, define MVN_HOME environment variable directed at install location.
Add MVN_HOME to the PATH. 
Run "mvn --version" to ensure Maven 2 is present.

1. Download glossitope project (http://desklets.googlecode.com/svn/trunk). 
Main project (trunk) has sub projects for "container" and "spec" 
(standard desklets and www are also present but not addressed here). 
Trunk has a "pom.xml" Maven project descriptor, *and* so do sub projects container and spec. 

2. "container" build, cd to PROJ_TRUNK/container and issue maven commands to build/run, etc.

PROJ_TRUNK\container>mvn clean assembly:assembly

PROJ_TRUNK\container\target>java -cp ./glossitope-container-1.0-jar-withependencies.jar org.glossitope.container.Main


The first step "assembly:assembly" will use the Maven assembly plugin to create a Glossitope
"jar-with-dependencies" jar.  This is a jar that includes the container itself, 
and all the dependencies. The second step is running the freshly built from container 
on the command line via the "jar-with-dependencies" jar. 

*NOTE* You can use the Maven -o switch to run faster in "offline" mode once you have
the dependencies.  You can also use the -Dmaven.test.skip=true system property to skip tests when required. 


IDE Notes:
----------
Maven is the "authoritative" build.  Using the Maven files though you can easily
create projects that are accessible to various IDEs, including Netbeans and Eclipse.

Netbeans: Use Mevenide to create an nbproject (http://mevenide.codehaus.org/m2-site/).
TODO - more detail here.

Eclipse: Use the Maven Eclipse plugin to create an Eclipse project:
"mvn eclipse:eclipse"
This will generate the .classpath and .project files needed for Eclipse. 
From there you can import the project into Eclipse (import existing project).
You must also bind the Eclipse Classpath Variable "M2_REPO" to your local 
repository (typically ~/.m2/repository).


Repository Notes:
-----------------
Currently Glossitope is built from several Maven repositories.  This is something
we plan to clean up and eventually rely on only two main, organized, repos. 
(Maven/Ibiblio for global deps, and a specific Glossitope (ab5k) repository hosted at Google Code).
