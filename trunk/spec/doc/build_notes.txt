AB5K Maven Build Notes - spec:
==============================

Prerequisite:
------------
Requires Maven 2 - http://maven.apache.org/.
Install/unpack Maven 2, define MVN_HOME environment variable directed at install location.
Add MVN_HOME to the PATH. 
Run "mvn --version" to ensure Maven 2 is present.

1. Download ab5k project (URL HERE). 
Main project (trunk) has sub projects for "container" and "spec" 
(standard desklets and www are also present but not addressed here). 
Trunk has a "pom.xml" Maven project descriptor, *and* so do sub projects container and spec. 

2. "spec" build, cd to PROJ_TRUNK/spec and issue maven commands to build.

PROJ_TRUNK\spec>mvn clean package

The Maven package plugin will create an artifact, in this case a jar, for the project.
The "spec" jar is then used as a dependency for the container and desklets. Building
the spec is not required (unless you want to hack on the spec itself). An existing
jar of the latest spec is in the ab5k google code repo (/mavenrepo). 


IDE Notes:
----------
Maven is the "authoritative" build.  Using the Maven files though you can easily
create projects that are accessible to various IDEs, including Netbeans and Eclipse.

Netbeans: Use Mevenide to create an nbproject (http://mevenide.codehaus.org/m2-site/).
TODO - more detail here.

Eclipse: Use the Maven Eclipse plugin to create an Eclipse project:
"mvn eclipse:eclipse"
This will generate the .classpath and .project files needed for Eclipse. 
From there you can import the project into Eclipse (import existing project).
You must also bind the Eclipse Classpath Variable "M2_REPO" to your local 
repository (typically ~/.m2/repository).


Repository Notes:
-----------------
Currently ab5k is built from several Maven repositories.  This is something
we plan to clean up and eventually rely on only two main, organized, repos. 
(Maven/Ibiblio for global deps, and a specificab5k repository hosted at Google Code).
