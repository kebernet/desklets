Webstart/JNLP Notes
===================

Currently using the Codehaus:
http://mojo.codehaus.org/webstart-maven-plugin-parent/webstart-maven-plugin/introduction.html.

To use you must have the correct settings in the POM file (the checked in passwords and such 
are nonsense) and you must have a local keystore (keystore can be created with keytool).

The webstart plugin will use jarsigner, against the container jar (which must be present)
to sign and overwrite.

"mvn clean package webstart:jnlp"

This will create a target/jnlp directory with webstart files. 
The src/jnlp/template.vm

(Also, I left the src/deployment dir as is, we can build JNLP the old fashioned way too.)
